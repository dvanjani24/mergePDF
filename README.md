# mergePDF
I found myself encountering various situations where a company, organization, or class required me to submit one pdf file that required merging various separate pdf files.
Although there are various online pdf merging sites, I wanted to code my own personal script, as some of the sites online seemed unreliable. 

The script allows users to input any number of pdfs that they'd like to merge.
